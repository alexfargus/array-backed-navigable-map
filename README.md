# array-backed-navigable-map

This is an implementation of the NavigableMap interface on top of an ArrayList where the key is the index into the array.

It is proof of concept code that I wrote over the course of a weekend to test an idea for a potential solution to a problem that I was facing at work. 
I make no claim that this is production ready.

You can find more details on the motivation and design decisions in my blog post [here](http://www.fargus.eu/blog/2016/12/17/high-frequency-timeseries-datastructure).
